# World Citizen ID Kit
Client Side PGP Signing and Bitcoin Time Stamping Tool 

## World Citizen ID Hacks
This is a small client side webpage that forms part of suite of tools following on from the work of Chris Ellis on [World Citizenship](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship).  

This work was designed and commissioned by David Bailey and written by [David Lucid](http://davidlucid.com/).

## Instructions
Simply download the html file above or click on Download Zip/Clone Repo and then load up sign.html in to your browser window.  

You will need an existing PGP key see:  
[GPG Tools](https://gpgtools.org/gpgsuite.html)  
[gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) (Windows users)  

## Goal and Motivation
Building on from the [ID Cards](http://citizen.cards/) the purpose of this demo is to as a learning tool to help people understand how these kinds of cryptographic tools can work locally and in a way that is easy to inspect and learn from.  

The code is designed to run in the world’s most popular application, the web browser, and it’s designed to run on the user’s personal computer where they have control.  

There are larger projects that have longer term goals for scaling.
